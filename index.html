Outfield players are usually specialised in attacking or defending or both. A team is typically split into defenders, midfielders and forwards, though there is no restriction on players moving anywhere on the pitch. It is known as soccer in North America, but is called football in most of the rest of the world. Its full name is Association Football</p>

        <hr>
        <p class = "def">Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases.[2] A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.</p>

        <hr>
        <p class = "def">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat and before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.</p>
        <!--Basketball -->

        <h3 class = "sport">Basketball</h3>

        <img class = "pic" src = "Basketball.png" height = 10% width = 10% align = "right" alt = "Soccer ball">
        <hr>
        <p class = "def">Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.</p>

        <p class = "def">Ice hockey, a game between two teams, each usually having six players, who wear skates and compete on an ice rink. The object is to propel a vulcanized rubber disk, the puck, past a goal line and into a net guarded by a goaltender, or goalie. With its speed and its frequent physical contact, ice hockey has become one of the most popular of international sports. The game is an Olympic sport, and worldwide there are more than a million registered players performing regularly in leagues. It is perhaps Canadaâ€™s most popular game.</p>

        <p class = "def">Golf is an individual sport played by hitting a ball with a club from a tee into a hole. The object is to get the ball into the hole with the least number of swings or strokes of the club. Golf is a hugely popular sport that is enjoyed by people of all ages. Golf is often played competitively, but can also be played for relaxation and just to enjoy the outdoors. The playing area for golf is called a golf course. Unlike many sports, the course is not a standard or fixed size. Courses vary in length and design. This is one of the many aspects of golf that have made it so popular and interesting. Many people enjoy trying out and experiencing different courses. Courses can be very different depending on the local terrain. Many golf courses are famous and known for their beauty or difficulty. Each golf course is made up of a number of golf holes. Usually 18 holes, but some courses only have 9 holes. On each hole the golfer first hits the ball from a tee area towards the hole. The hole is on a smooth area of short grass called the green. Typically it will take the golfer a number of shots to get to the green. Once the golf ball is on the green, the golfer will use a putter to roll or "putt" the ball into the hole. The number of strokes are counted up for the hole and recorded on a score card. At the end of the course all the strokes are totaled and the golfer with the fewest number of strokes wins.</p>
